This project compares the relationship between International Governmental Organization (IGO) membership and engagement in interstate conflict. It uses data from the Correlates of War Project to assess if higher membership in IGOs (measured by the number of member years a state has total for the period 1814-2010) is correlated with the state being involved in fewer conflicts (measured as the number of times a state either used force or engaged in war during the same timespan). After running a robust linear regression, there is tentative evidence for a correlation between IGO membership and less violent conflict.
